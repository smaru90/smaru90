### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<h3>About me</h3>

<p>
I am a former seaman who decided to change industries in order to spend more time with my family, as well as to improve myself in an industry that has fascinated me since my college days.
</p>
<p>
As of today, I already have a pretty good knowledge of HTML, CSS, https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d2e764d63294c27eff3598ae3a0df5884b4efcabbdbbd200e51472cddf4a3f03/68747470733a2f2f74656368737461636b2d67656e657261746f722e76657263656c2e6170702f6a732d69636f6e2e737667 and React. 
</p>
<p>
My first project was the website of the kickboxing club where I train. 
</p>
<p>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a search engine for football players who can be sorted by their age, position, or skill level, etc.
</p>
<p>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and PHP.
</p>
<p>
In the future, I would like to create an application that will help repair mechanics on ships/power plants or other large enterprises.
